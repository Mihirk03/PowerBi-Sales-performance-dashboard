# Sales-Performance-Dashboard

## Problem Statement

In today's competitive market, sales teams must continuously monitor and analyze their performance to meet targets and drive growth. However, the current process of tracking sales metrics across various regions, products, and time periods is fragmented and inefficient. Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as revenue, sales growth, product performance, and regional sales distribution are scattered across multiple reports, making it challenging for stakeholders to gain a comprehensive view of sales performance in real-time.

The lack of a centralized and interactive platform hinders the ability to quickly identify trends, uncover insights, and make data-driven decisions. As a result, opportunities to optimize sales strategies, allocate resources effectively, and address underperforming areas may be missed, leading to suboptimal business outcomes.
